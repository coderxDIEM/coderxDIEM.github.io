■	What your page does

Ans: I have created this personal portfolio website, which consists of a few sections, namely, about me, my story, gallery and contact. 


●	Do a short description to walk us through your intentions/thoughts behind the creation of this page. You can include relevant hand-drawn sketches/etc.

Ans: First is the "about me" section which consist of a short snippet about myself, where I have put a button to attract the readers and for them to click and find out more about me. Next, is "my story" section where I share my experience of my recent trip to Korea, my interests of climbing mountain as well as my cycling hobby. This section was included to give readers a sneak peek into my life. Subsequently come the gallery segment, where I wanted to share some awesome and beautiful taken  pictures of nature around the world. Finally, there is this contact me part where readers can insert their message and I will reply them via email. 


■	Challenges faced and how you overcame them

Despite watching and following the video lecture by Frae on how to create a landing page, I still faced quite a bit of difficulty along the way while trying to create this webpage. This is because my very basic knowledge of html and css + zero knowledge on JavaScript made it really hard for me to understand Frae's code. Furthermore, the limited knowledge also made it hard for me while designing the webpage and trying to debug. Luckily Frae is very responsive and helpful, I worked with him closely to create my personal website. Of course along the way, I also had to do quite a bit of googling in order to understand the syntax of the code.
